            <h2>The hashtag symbol is technically called an octothorpe. </h2>
            <p>
              According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, the "octo-" prefix
              refers to the eight points on the popular symbol, but the "thorpe"
              remains a mystery. One theory claims that it comes from the Old
              English word for "village," based on the idea that the symbol
              looks like a village surrounded by eight fields!

              Yes, that tall, pleated white hat that chefs wear — technically
              called a toque — has 100 folds for a reason! According to
              Reclutant Gourmet, the pleats used to signify a chef's level of
              experience, like the number of ways he or she knew how to prepare
              eggs.
